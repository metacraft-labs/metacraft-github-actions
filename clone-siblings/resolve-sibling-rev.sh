# resolve-sibling-rev.sh — resolve a sibling repo's pinned revision from the
# workspace-lock model.
#
# This is the SINGLE approved source of sibling revisions for cross-repo CI and
# for local cross-repo test runs. It reads the per-commit lock snapshot that the
# workspace tooling produces for the commit under test.
#
# TWO LOCK LAYOUTS ARE SUPPORTED, because the Metacraft workspaces are midway
# through migrating from `repo-workspaces` to `reprobuild` and this action is
# shared by projects on both:
#
#   repo-workspaces (legacy)  <manifest-repo>/locks/<project>/<repo>/<sha>.xml
#     a ``repo manifest -r`` snapshot; one ``<project name=... revision=.../>``
#     element per line.
#
#   reprobuild (current)      <manifest-repo>/locks/<project>/<repo>/<sha>.toml
#     a ``schema = "reprobuild.workspace.lock.v1"`` document: a ``[lock]``
#     header table plus one ``[[repo]]`` table per pinned repo, carrying
#     ``name`` / ``path`` / ``remote`` / ``revision`` / ``branch``.
#
# The two agree on everything that matters here: the same directory key
# (project / trigger repo / full commit SHA), and the same identity for a
# sibling — its repo NAME, which may differ from its workspace path (``nim``
# lives at ``codetracer-nim``). Only the file extension and the body syntax
# differ, so both are read through one code path with two small parsers.
#
# The historical flat spelling ``locks/<project>/<repo>-<sha>.<ext>`` is also
# accepted, for both extensions.
#
# Legacy ``.github/sibling-pins`` / ``.github/sibling-pins.json`` /
# ``.github/rr-backend-pin.txt`` files and the ``locks/<project>/index.json``
# layout are NOT used: the lock keyed by the commit-under-test is the only
# mechanism.
#
# A given repo commit may be locked under several workspaces (e.g. the canonical
# ``codetracer`` workspace plus feature workspaces such as ``mcr``/``dev``); the
# lock location depends on which workspace pushed the commit. We therefore search
# across workspaces, preferring the canonical project when more than one lock
# matches.
#
# Usage:
#   resolve-sibling-rev.sh --repo SELF --sibling NAME \
#       [--manifest-dir DIR] [--sha COMMIT]... [--repo-dir DIR] \
#       [--prefer-project PROJECT] [--no-walk]
#
#   --repo SELF         repo under test (e.g. codetracer, codetracer-ci)
#   --sibling NAME      sibling repo whose revision to print
#   --manifest-dir DIR  manifest-repo checkout containing locks/.  Default:
#                       $CT_MANIFEST_DIR, else the nearest enclosing
#                       .repro/manifests (reprobuild) or .repo/manifests
#                       (repo-workspaces) discovered by walking up from
#                       --repo-dir.
#   --sha COMMIT        candidate commit(s) whose lock to use, in priority order.
#                       Repeatable.  Default: HEAD of --repo-dir.
#   --repo-dir DIR      working copy of SELF (for HEAD + ancestry walk).
#                       Default: current directory.
#   --prefer-project P  workspace/project to prefer when several match.
#                       Default: the value of --repo (its canonical workspace).
#   --no-walk           do not walk ancestry; require a direct lock on a
#                       candidate SHA (used by shallow CI checkouts).
#
# Resolution order for the lock to read:
#   1. Each --sha candidate, in order, that has a lock.
#   2. Otherwise (unless --no-walk), the nearest first-parent ancestor of the
#      first candidate that has a lock.  This makes local runs work even when
#      HEAD is unpushed (hence unlocked): siblings are unchanged since the last
#      locked ancestor, so its pin is correct.
#
# ``--no-walk`` remains correct for CI under both layouts. It exists because CI
# checkouts are shallow, so ``git rev-list --first-parent`` sees only HEAD and
# the walk would be a no-op that merely hides the real diagnosis. Nothing in the
# reprobuild lock changes that: like the XML snapshot it records only the pinned
# revisions of the workspace at one commit, carrying no ancestry of its own, so
# it cannot substitute for history the checkout does not have.
#
# Prints the resolved revision (a commit SHA) to stdout.  Exits non-zero, with a
# diagnostic on stderr, when no lock can be found or the sibling is absent — CI
# must fail loudly rather than silently fall back to an unpinned branch tip.
#
# Exit codes:
#   2  usage error
#   3  no manifest dir, or no lock for any candidate commit
#   4  a lock was found but does not mention the sibling
#   5  a lock was found but is malformed / carries no usable revision
#   6  two locks for the SAME commit disagree about the sibling
#
# Codes 4/5/6 all mean "a lock exists but cannot be trusted to answer". They are
# deliberately distinct from 3 so a caller probing several candidate commits can
# tell "this commit is not locked" (try the next) from "this commit's lock is
# broken" (stop and report).
#
# Contract suite: ./resolve-sibling-rev-test.sh (pure bash; run it after any
# change here — this action is shared by several Metacraft projects).

#
#   1. project — locks under the canonical project win outright over locks under

#   2. layout — within the winning project, the nested layout wins outright over
#      the flat one. They are not two descriptions of one state: `locks/<proj>/
#      <repo>-<sha>.xml` is the HISTORICAL spelling, and where the tooling wrote
#      both for one commit the nested file is the later, canonical one. The
#      manifest repo really does carry such pairs, with the flat member stale by
#      dozens of revisions, and the flat file has always lost. Treating that as
#      an unresolvable conflict would fail commits that resolve correctly today.
#   3. extension — whatever survives is returned for ALL extensions present, so
#      an .xml and a .toml written for the same commit by the two workspace
#      tools are cross-checked against each other rather than silently resolved
#      by glob order. THIS is the migration hazard worth refusing: neither
#      spelling is the elder, so there is no basis for preferring one.

#     --upload-pack=<cmd>` runs <cmd>. git parses options after the remote, so
#     this is remote code execution on the runner.

# resolve-sibling-rev.sh — resolve a sibling repo's pinned revision from the
# workspace-lock model.
#
# This is the SINGLE approved source of sibling revisions for cross-repo CI and
# for local cross-repo test runs. It reads the per-commit lock snapshot that the
# workspace tooling produces for the commit under test.
#
# TWO LOCK LAYOUTS ARE SUPPORTED, because the Metacraft workspaces are midway
# through migrating from `repo-workspaces` to `reprobuild` and this action is
# shared by projects on both:
#
#   repo-workspaces (legacy)  <manifest-repo>/locks/<project>/<repo>/<sha>.xml
#     a ``repo manifest -r`` snapshot; one ``<project name=... revision=.../>``
#     element per line.
#
#   reprobuild (current)      <manifest-repo>/locks/<project>/<repo>/<sha>.toml
#     a ``schema = "reprobuild.workspace.lock.v1"`` document: a ``[lock]``
#     header table plus one ``[[repo]]`` table per pinned repo, carrying
#     ``name`` / ``path`` / ``remote`` / ``revision`` / ``branch``.
#
# The two agree on everything that matters here: the same directory key
# (project / trigger repo / full commit SHA), and the same identity for a
# sibling — its repo NAME, which may differ from its workspace path (``nim``
# lives at ``codetracer-nim``). Only the file extension and the body syntax
# differ, so both are read through one code path with two small parsers.
#
# The historical flat spelling ``locks/<project>/<repo>-<sha>.<ext>`` is also
# accepted, for both extensions.
#
# Legacy ``.github/sibling-pins`` / ``.github/sibling-pins.json`` /
# ``.github/rr-backend-pin.txt`` files and the ``locks/<project>/index.json``
# layout are NOT used: the lock keyed by the commit-under-test is the only
# mechanism.
#
# A given repo commit may be locked under several workspaces (e.g. the canonical
# ``codetracer`` workspace plus feature workspaces such as ``mcr``/``dev``); the
# lock location depends on which workspace pushed the commit. We therefore search
# across workspaces, preferring the canonical project when more than one lock
# matches.
#
# MANIFEST LAYERS (public / org / team / personal)
# -----------------------------------------------
#
# A workspace's repo set is not necessarily described by ONE manifest repo.
# ``reprobuild-specs/Workspace-And-Develop-Mode.md`` §"Workspace Composition and
# Manifest Layers" specifies a layered model: a public manifest repo defines the
# base repo set, an org/team-private manifest repo (access-controlled,
# VCS-backed, REQUIRED when private repos participate) extends it, and a
# personal manifest repo or purely local workspace metadata sits on top. Repos
# declared in several layers are deduplicated, "with the more specific (private)
# layer taking precedence for overrides".
#
# ``--manifest-dir`` is therefore REPEATABLE, and the order is the precedence
# order: LEAST specific first (public), MOST specific last (private/personal).
# Passing it once is exactly the single-layer behaviour this resolver has always
# had — nothing changes for a caller that names one manifest repo.
#
# Across layers, for the one commit selected below:
#
#   * every layer that carries a lock for that commit is consulted;
#   * a MALFORMED lock (exit 5) or a lock pair that CONTRADICTS itself inside
#     one layer (exit 6) still fails the whole resolve. Untrustworthy data is
#     never skipped in favour of a layer that happens to look healthier;
#   * a layer whose lock simply does not name the sibling contributes nothing.
#     This is the normal case for a private layer that pins only private repos,
#     and is NOT the intra-layer exit-4 condition;
#   * when more than one layer pins the sibling, the MOST SPECIFIC (last) one
#     wins and the shadowing is reported on stderr. This is the spec's override
#     rule, not a coin toss: unlike the xml-vs-toml case inside one layer, the
#     layers are explicitly ordered by the caller;
#   * when NO layer pins it although some layer had a lock, that is exit 4.
#
# Usage:
#   resolve-sibling-rev.sh --repo SELF --sibling NAME \
#       [--manifest-dir DIR]... [--sha COMMIT]... [--repo-dir DIR] \
#       [--prefer-project PROJECT] [--no-walk]
#
#   --repo SELF         repo under test (e.g. codetracer, codetracer-ci)
#   --sibling NAME      sibling repo whose revision to print
#   --manifest-dir DIR  manifest-repo checkout containing locks/.  REPEATABLE;
#                       least-specific layer first, most-specific last.
#                       Default: $CT_MANIFEST_DIR (+ $CT_PRIVATE_MANIFEST_DIR
#                       layered on top of it), else the layers discovered by
#                       walking up from --repo-dir (see below).
#   --sha COMMIT        candidate commit(s) whose lock to use, in priority order.
#                       Repeatable.  Default: HEAD of --repo-dir.
#   --repo-dir DIR      working copy of SELF (for HEAD + ancestry walk).
#                       Default: current directory.
#   --prefer-project P  workspace/project to prefer when several match.
#                       Default: the value of --repo (its canonical workspace).
#   --no-walk           do not walk ancestry; require a direct lock on a
#                       candidate SHA (used by shallow CI checkouts).
#
# Auto-discovered layers, in precedence order (least → most specific), at the
# nearest enclosing workspace root:
#
#   .repro/manifests              the public manifest checkout (reprobuild), or
#   .repo/manifests               the legacy repo-workspaces one when the
#                                 reprobuild layer carries no locks/
#   .repro/manifests-<n>-<slug>   URL-backed ``[[manifest]]`` layers, ordered by
#                                 ``<n>`` NUMERICALLY (the layer's index in the
#                                 workspace's ``[[manifest]]`` array) — not by
#                                 glob order, which would sort ``manifests-10-x``
#                                 ahead of ``manifests-2-x``
#   .repro/manifests-private      the RA-11 private companion manifest checkout
#                                 (``[manifest] private_url`` /
#                                 ``.repro-workspace-private.toml``)
#
# The extra layers are picked up under ``.repro/`` whichever base won, so a
# legacy ``.repo/manifests`` base does not silently drop a private companion.
# A ``.repro/manifests-<name>`` directory whose name does NOT encode an index
# (a hand-written ``local_path`` such as ``manifests-team``) cannot be ordered
# from disk at all, so auto-discovery REFUSES (exit 3) and asks for explicit
# ``--manifest-dir`` layers rather than guessing.
#
# Resolution order for the COMMIT whose lock to read (one commit for every
# layer — the layers describe one workspace state, so they must be read at the
# same commit or they are not layers at all):
#   1. Each --sha candidate, in order, for which ANY layer has a lock.
#   2. Otherwise (unless --no-walk), the nearest first-parent ancestor of the
#      first candidate for which any layer has a lock.  This makes local runs
#      work even when HEAD is unpushed (hence unlocked): siblings are unchanged
#      since the last locked ancestor, so its pin is correct.
#
# ``--no-walk`` remains correct for CI under both layouts. It exists because CI
# checkouts are shallow, so ``git rev-list --first-parent`` sees only HEAD and
# the walk would be a no-op that merely hides the real diagnosis. Nothing in the
# reprobuild lock changes that: like the XML snapshot it records only the pinned
# revisions of the workspace at one commit, carrying no ancestry of its own, so
# it cannot substitute for history the checkout does not have.
#
# Prints the resolved revision (a commit SHA) to stdout.  Exits non-zero, with a
# diagnostic on stderr, when no lock can be found or the sibling is absent — CI
# must fail loudly rather than silently fall back to an unpinned branch tip.
#
# Exit codes:
#   2  usage error
#   3  no manifest dir, or no lock for any candidate commit
#   4  a lock was found but no layer mentions the sibling
#   5  a lock was found but is malformed / carries no usable revision
#   6  two locks for the SAME commit IN ONE LAYER disagree about the sibling
#
# Codes 4/5/6 all mean "a lock exists but cannot be trusted to answer". They are
# deliberately distinct from 3 so a caller probing several candidate commits can
# tell "this commit is not locked" (try the next) from "this commit's lock is
# broken" (stop and report).

# --- locate the manifest layers (locks/ trees) ----------------------------
#
# `.repro/manifests` (reprobuild) is checked before `.repo/manifests`
# (repo-workspaces): a workspace that has migrated keeps the old `.repo`
# directory around for a while, and the stale layer must not shadow the live
# one. A layer that exists but has no `locks/` loses to one that has it.
#
# On top of that PUBLIC base, auto-discovery also picks up the private layers a
# reprobuild workspace materialises next to it (Workspace-And-Develop-Mode.md
# §"Manifest Sources"; the on-disk names are RA-11's):
#
#   .repro/manifests-<n>-<slug>   URL-backed `[[manifest]]` layers
#   .repro/manifests-private      the `[manifest] private_url` companion
#
# They are appended AFTER the public layer, so they take precedence over it —
# and `-private` is appended last of all, because it is the most specific layer
# a workspace can have on disk. A layer with no `locks/` subtree is skipped
# rather than reported: an org manifest that carries only `projects/` fragments
# and no lock records is a normal, complete layer, it just has nothing to say
# about revisions.
#
# The `<n>` in `manifests-<n>-<slug>` is the layer's index in the workspace's
# `[[manifest]]` array (`repro_workspace_manifests/compose.nim` builds the name
# as "manifests-" & $index & "-" & sanitizeForPath(url)), and THAT is the
# precedence order — not the alphabet. Glob order sorts `manifests-10-x` before
# `manifests-2-x`, which would silently invert precedence for any workspace with
# ten or more URL-backed layers, so the numbered layers are sorted on `<n>`
# numerically below.
#
# A `manifests-<something>` directory whose name does NOT encode an index —
# a hand-written `local_path` such as `.repro/manifests-team` or
# `.repro/manifests-personal` — carries no orderable information at all: its
# position lives only in the workspace config's `[[manifest]]` array. Ordering
# such layers alphabetically would make `manifests-team` override
# `manifests-personal`, which is backwards, and it would be a guess either way.
# Auto-discovery therefore REFUSES rather than choosing, and tells the caller to
# order the layers explicitly with `--manifest-dir`. Skipping the layer instead
# would be the silent downgrade to a less specific answer that the whole layering
# model exists to prevent.
